<p align="left">

---

I first started C# as a hobby, then I fell in love with solving problems using codes and it all got started...

I decided to learn everything there is, and I did. I learned a little bit of everything ;) Web, Windows, Mobile, Front, Back, even Network, OS, and Computer Science... After becoming a jack of all trades & master of none, I finally found my interest in web development and became a master of one.

Half a year ago I started my job as a freelancer and started doing small projects as I was learning and growing my skills. I'm still learning and this is an endless process in web design's endless world. Despite the fact now I have a proven history of strong ethics and passion for web design and have the confidence that there is no problem big enough I can't tackle or learn to tackle.

Now my passion is developing a pretty unique and accessible website that helps your business shine and grow. That's why permanent self-study and learning the most current best practices in my job are my high-level priorities. As you should have found out by now, I'm a lover and a developer. :)
